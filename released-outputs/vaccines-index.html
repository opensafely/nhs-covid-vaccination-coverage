        <p><a href="https://www.opensafely.org/">OpenSAFELY</a> is a new
            secure analytics platform for electronic patient records
            built on behalf of NHS England to deliver urgent academic and
            operational research during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Since December 2020 we have provided regular reporting of COVID 
            vaccination coverage in England, adding functionality and content
            in response to developments during the pandemic.
            Our analysis uses data from 40% of general practices that use TPP
            electronic health record software. <strong>The data requires careful
            interpretation and there are a number of caveats. Please read the
            full detail about our methods and discussion of our earlier results
            as of 17 March 2021) in our paper available
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2021.0376">here</a>.</strong></p>

            report are available

        <p><strong>Update: As of 17th January 2022, our vaccine reports will be
            published fortnightly.  If you rely on weekly data updates for your
            own reporting or analysis please contact team@opensafely.org to let
            us know.</strong></p>
