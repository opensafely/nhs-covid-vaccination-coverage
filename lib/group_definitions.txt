### Group definitions
- Patient age is calculated on the date of extraction from date of birth; note that, to minimise risk of disclosure, all dates of birth are rounded down to the first of the month in OpenSAFELY.
- The **care home** group is defined based on patients (aged 65+) having one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/longres/v.1.5.3/).
- The **shielding** group is defined based on patients (aged 16-69) having one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/shield/v.1.5.3/) provided it was not superceded by one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/nonshield/v.1.5.3/).            
- The **LD** (learning disability) group is defined based on patients (aged 16-64) having one of [these](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/learndis/v.1.5.3/) codes and excludes people who are shielding.
- Patients are counted in their highest risk category only; e.g. a 65-year-old who is shielding is only counted in the shielding group, not in the 65-69 group.
- The **housebound** group is defined based on [this](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/housebound/5bc77310/)
codelist and excludes people who were later recorded as [not housebound](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/no-longer-housebound/29a88ca6/) or in a [care home](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/longres/v.1.5.3/).
