### Group definitions
- As of 29 Nov 2021, patient age is calculated at 31 Aug 2021 (previously 31 March 2021), in line with [national reporting](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1036047/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_47.pdf). 
- The **care home** group is defined based on patients (aged 65+) having one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/longres/v1/).
- The **shielding** group is defined based on patients (aged 16-69) having one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/shield/v1/) provided it was not superceded by one of [these codes](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/nonshield/v1/).            
- The **LD** (learning disability) group is defined based on patients (aged 16-64) having one of [these](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/primis-covid19-vacc-uptake/learndis/v1/) codes and excludes people who are shielding.
- Patients are counted in their highest risk category only; e.g. a 65-year-old who is shielding is only counted in the shielding group, not in the 65-69 group.
- The **housebound** group is defined based on [this](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/housebound/5bc77310/)
