### Group definitions
- Patient age is calculated on the date of extraction from date of birth; note that, to minimise risk of disclosure, all dates of birth are rounded down to the first of the month in OpenSAFELY.
- The patients who are 'In a risk group' have been identified using the criteria in Table 4 of [the Green Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057798/Greenbook-chapter-14a-28Feb22.pdf) and codelists from SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) Vaccine Uptake Reporting Specification Collection 2020/2021 (v1.5.3) as [distributed by PRIMIS](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/primis/data-specification/covid-19/covid-19.aspx).
