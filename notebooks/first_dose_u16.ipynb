    "# OpenSAFELY COVID Vaccine coverage report: first doses for 5 to 15 year olds\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSAFELY is a new secure analytics platform for electronic patient records built on behalf of NHS England to deliver urgent academic and operational research during the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since December 2020 we have been reporting on COVID-19 vaccination coverage (for patients aged 16 and over) in England using data from 40% of general practices that use TPP electronic health record software. In [September 2021](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/09/nhs-rolls-out-covid-19-jab-to-children-aged-12-to-15/), the COVID vaccination programme was extended to 12-15 year olds. The [Living with Covid guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19) was updated in February 2022 to advise that vaccines would be offered to children between the ages of 5 and 11 from Spring 2022. As such, we are now regularly reporting on vaccination coverage for children between the age of 5 and 15. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The data requires careful interpretation and there are a number of caveats, please refer to our peer-reviewed publications (https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2021.0376) for further details. While this publication describes an analysis of vaccine uptake in those 16 and over, it is relevant here as the core functionality has been repurposed to generate our vaccine coverage reports for 5-15 year olds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The full analytical methods behind the latest results in this report are available [here](https://github.com/opensafely/nhs-covid-vaccination-uptake). "

    "The 30 microgram dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 was approved for use in 12-15 year olds in June 2021. In December 2021, the MHRA approved a 10 microgram dose for children aged 5-11 years.  Where the paediatric formulation is not available, 10 micrograms (0.1ml) of the diluted adult vaccine may be used as an alternative. The Moderna vaccine has also been approved for use in 12-17 year olds.\n",
